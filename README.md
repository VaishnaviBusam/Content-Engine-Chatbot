# 📚 Content Engine Chatbot

An interactive content-based chatbot that uses document embeddings, semantic search, and language generation to provide answers to user queries. This project leverages pre-trained models to extract, index, and analyze information from company reports, offering real-time insights through a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

---

## 🌟 Features
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Extracts text data from company PDF reports (e.g., Google, Tesla, Uber).
- **Embeddings for Semantic Search**: Uses sentence embeddings to generate vector representations, enabling meaningful document retrieval.
- **Database for Indexing**: Stores embeddings in ChromaDB for efficient querying and retrieval.
- **Language Model for Responses**: Generates context-aware responses using a pre-trained language model.
- **Web App Interface**: Provides an interactive user interface with Streamlit, accessible via a secure public link using ngrok.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **PDF Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF documents using `PyMuPDF`, creating a basis for content analysis.
2. **Generate Embeddings**: Uses `SentenceTransformer` to create semantic embeddings, which are stored for fast retrieval.
3. **Indexing with ChromaDB**: Stores document embeddings and metadata in ChromaDB for easy access and querying.
4. **Query and Response**: Answers user queries based on indexed document content, with text-generation capabilities from `transformers`.
5. **Interactive Web Interface**: Streamlit provides an intuitive interface for users to ask questions and receive answers in real-time.

## 📖 Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Content-Engine-Chatbot.git
   cd Content-Engine-Chatbot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install required Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install streamlit langchain llama-index chromadb sentence-transformers pymupdf transformers pyngrok
     ```

3. **Mount Google Drive** (if using Colab):
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

4. **Run the App**:
   - Use `app.py` to start the Streamlit application:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

5. **Expose the App using ngrok**:
   ```bash
   ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

   Copy the public URL generated by ngrok and access the app through it.
